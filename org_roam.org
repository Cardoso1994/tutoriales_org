#+title: Org Roam

* Create a new node
=org-roam-node-find= opens the completion engine to open a previously created
node; if we write the name of a nonexistent node, org roam will create it. In order to
save the node we need to /finish/ it with =C-c C-c= or the keybinding shown in the
headerline of the buffer.

* Insert node link inside anothe node
=org-roam-node-insert= will open the completion buffer so we can select a node,
then a link is inserted on the current buffer to such node. This works in a
similar manner as =org-roam-node-find=, if we write the name of a nonexistent
node, roam will create it for us.
* Backlinks buffer
=org-roam-buffer-toggle= opens the backlinks buffer, wich allows to see other
nodes that have a link to the current node, so we can start to see connections
between subjects that we did not think before.

This buffer automatically updates when switching to another node.
